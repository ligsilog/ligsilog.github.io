        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">The most common drones today are quadcopters, meaning that they have four propellers. Compared to a plane, a quadcopter can hover due to how its propellers are positioned. From the four propellers, two are set to spin clockwise and the other two is set to spin counterclockwise.<br><br>It is important to keep that in mind since the blades of the propeller are angled accordingly. Usually, modern drones have this as a format: front left and back right rotates clockwise, and front right and back left rotates counterclockwise.<br><br><strong>Quadcopter movement and propeller motion<br></strong>
<br>Basically, the propeller is responsible for generating thrust. Thrust is the upward force that lifts the drone. The thrust generated by the propeller must be greater than the force of gravity and its weight for it to fly upward. The faster the propeller spins, the greater the thrust produced. And for the drone’s other movements, the acceleration of each individual propeller come into play. These movements are known as yaw, pitch, and roll.<br> 
<br>Its forward and backward movement can be referred as pitch. To achieve this, the acceleration of the set of propellers in the front or the back are adjusted. For the forward movement, the set of propellers in the back are accelerated. And when the front set are accelerated, the drone is brought backwards.<br> 
<br>Roll is the sideways flight of the quadcopter or the rotation around its longitudinal axis. This is achieved by swinging the drone in left or right direction. This is often confused with yaw.<br> 
<br>Yaw, compared to roll, pertains to the rotation around the vertical axis. This movement refers to to how the drone turns to its left or right. For this kind of rotation to occur, the propellers opposite each other are either accelerated or decelerated.<br> 
<br>The movement of each propeller is controlled by a motor. This motor follows a circuit called Electronic Speed Control circuit. This circuit is responsible for the motor’s rotational speed. The circuit is connected to a central flight controller that receives commands from the remote controller.<br> 
<br>Now, the variability of the response from the remote controller to the execution of the action from the drone is dependent on the propeller. There are different factors in the aspect of the propeller that can greatly affect the flight of the quadcopter.<br><br><strong>Size and length</strong><br>
<br>There are different lengths and sizes to consider in choosing the size of propeller to use. Smaller ones require less torque from the motor to rotate the propeller. This allows greater speed but also lesser thrust and thus, the lift.<br><br> Longer propellers allow greater thrust due to its larger surface area. This can help the quadcopter to be more stable while it is hovering. However, due to its longer diameter and larger surface area, the drag is greater and will therefore require more power from the motor. This is why longer propellers are not usually viable if you are aiming for speed.<br><br><strong>Design</strong><br>
<br>Bullnose propeller is type of propeller used for drones nowadays. In contrast to the usual propeller with blades that are tapering at the end, bullnose propellers are greater in surface area. Because of its blunt end, the weight of the propeller itself is magnified at the ends which makes the rotational force greater and as a result, greater thrust is produced. However, the blunt end also adds drag.<br><br> Propeller with tapering ends, however, creates smoother movement as it slices through air flow. But it should be noted that the skinnier the propeller gets, the less thrust it can produce.<br> 
<br>Bullnose propellers are best suited for small racing frame drones since it can generate great thrust for a small-built drone. On the other hand, tapering-end propellers are more suited for aerial photography since it creates more stabilized movements.<br><br><strong>Number of blades<br></strong>
<br>For a quadcopter, the number of blades in a propeller can vary from two to four. The more blades there are, the greater the amount of thrust produced also with lesser motor power requirement. However, more blades can also mean that your quadcopter is more susceptible to turbulence while in flight.<br><br><strong>Material and Flexibility</strong><strong><br></strong><br>Propellers can be made of different kind of materials. Each type of material has its own flexibility. The more flexible a material is, the more it can withstand damage from a great amount of turbulence. But keep in mind that flexible materials can also be forced flat by the air pressure and thus reducing efficiency.<br> 
<br><strong>Choosing the best type of propeller<br></strong>
<br>Whether it is stability or speed you are aiming for, knowing how to choose the appropriate type of propeller can help you fly your drone easier. If you are using your drone for indoor racing, it is fair to use bullnose propellers with 3 or 4 blades. If you are to use your drone outside and for photography, it is best to use propellers with tapering ends and less blades since it is more stable in movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
