        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">The benefits of hemp plant extracts are gaining popularity in the recent years. And so far, organic cbd oil is the most promising.<br>
<br>The use of hemp products has been shrouded in social stigma because of the marijuana plant’s legal status. Though lately, it has been proven that not all substances found in marijuana can make you high.<br>
<br>CBD is a cannabinoid found in Cannabis sativa that doesn’t have psychoactive effects. It is a compound that indirectly affects the cannabinoid receptors in our body unlike the other compound which is thc or tetrahydrocannabinol.<br> 
<br>THC, as compared to cbd (cannabidiol), overwhelmingly binds with the cannabinoid receptors in our body. As a result, it throws off the balance of neurotransmitters in our brain which gives the feeling of being “high”.<br> 
<br>When this happens, neural processes that involves memory and alertness are impaired. Prolonged exposure to the chemical may cause addiction, memory impairment, and in some cases, mental health issues.<br> 
<br>Compared to THC, CBD doesn’t bind with the cannabinoid receptors. Rather, it lets our body’s naturally occurring cannabinoids do their job.<br> 
<br>This indirect stimulation of the cannabinoid receptors amplifies the effects of the natural cannabinoids in our body. In addition, cbd also affects other receptors in our body in various ways:<br> 
<br>•	CBD can directly affect serotonin receptors which leads to feelings of calmness and reduce anxiety and stress levels.<br>
<br>•	CBD is also known to interact with vallinoid receptors which are responsible for handling inflammation in our bodies, regulation of body temperature, and lessen pain.<br> 
<br>•	CBD acts as an antagonist to the “orphan receptor” GPR55 that is linked to the proliferation of cancer cells.<br> 
<br>•	CBD can help in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease since it also activates the PPAR-gamma receptors or the receptors responsible for the degradation of the substances linked to neurological disorders.<br> 
<br>It is important to note that THC is not all bad since it also gives the same benefits that cbd can. However, it should be accompanied by CBD to counteract its overwhelming binding properties with the cannabinoid receptors in our body.<br><br><strong>Benefits of cbd<br></strong>
<br>There are a lot of studies that proves the benefits of using cbd products. Commonly reported side effects of cbd oil products are tiredness and changes in weight. Diarrhea is a rarely reported case.<br> 
<br>In a study in January 2017 commissioned by the European Industrial Hemp Association, it was concluded that compared to other drugs administered for the treatment of psychotic disorders and epilepsy, cbd has a better safety profile.<br> 
<br>The study also noted the following where cbd can be used as an alternative course of treatment:<br>
<br>•	Post-traumatic stress disorder
<br>•	Obsessive-compulsive disorder
<br>•	Bipolar disorder
<br>•	Anxiety disorders
<br>•	Depression
<br>•	Schizophrenia
<br>•	Epilepsy
<br>•	Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s disease
<br>•	Cancers<br>
<br>If you are new to this and you want to try using cbd oil products, it is still best and recommended to consult with your doctor. However, you shouldn’t have to worry about using it as a daily supplement since cbd oil is generally considered safe to use.<br><br><strong>How to use cbd products<br></strong>
<br>Aside from treating diseases, cannabidiol products can be used as a supplement to improve memory, inner balance, and overall health. People nowadays have been creative in incorporating cbd oil in their diet.<br> 
<br>Some people smoke cbd vape liquids using a vape pen and others use cbd tinctures to add as an ingredient for baking, cooking, preparing fruit juices, and shakes.<br> 
<br>The most common method of administering the product is directly putting a drop of the oil underneath your tongue. This method is highly recommended since it is the fastest way that the product can be absorbed and be distributed by the lymphatic system throughout the body.<br>
<br>As a supplement, it is advised to take the product daily and correctly. Keep in mind the proper dosage indicated on the product or the dosage directed by your healthcare provider.<br>
<br>Also, do not forget to exercise regularly and have a healthy diet to achieve the maximum potential of the product.<br><br><strong>Keeping it organic!<br></strong>
<br>It should be noted that organic products should come from naturally grown plants that are not cultivated with the use of pesticides and harmful fertilizers. Organically grown plants are considered to be healthier than their industrial counterparts.<br> 
<br>Pesticides and fertilizers can pollute plants with heavy metals. These metals sometimes remain even after the extraction process and thus contaminating the end product that is given to the consumers.<br> 
<br>Presence of heavy metals in the product and exposure to it can be detrimental to your health. That is why you should choose cbd oil products that are guaranteed to have come from organically grown hemp plant.<br>
<br>Also, the process of extraction must keep the integrity of the organic product.<br><br> The overall production of the oil must not use commercialized harmful solvents.<br> 
<br>Though some brands remove these solvents from the formula, it is not guaranteed that there will be no residuals in the final product. So, when deciding to buy from a brand, make sure that they use organic solvents in the extraction process as well.<br><br><strong>Organic cbd oil<br></strong>
<br>There are a lot of cbd oil for sale in the market. Among all of these is CBDPure.<br>
<br>CBDPure is the most trusted and suggested brand when it comes to cbd oil. Its products had been certified by independent laboratories to have the highest quality possible.<br> 
<br>It is guaranteed to be 100% pure cbd oil without any trace of residual solvents used during extraction. Each batch also undergoes microbiological screening to certify that there are no harmful microorganisms that can be found in the final product.<br> 
<br>According to the reviews from its users, they prefer its taste compared to other brands because it is milder and more pleasant. This is because CBDPure products do not contain artificial flavorings in their formulation.<br>

<br>Cannabidiol is one of the most studied substance today because of its positive benefits and therapeutic effects. Compared to medical marijuana, it is preferred and suggested by a lot of healthcare providers.<br>
<br>It is completely legal since it does not give psychoactive effects to its users. 
<br>Using organic products such as the cbd oil have been gaining popularity because it can holistically improve physical and mental health without negative side effects.<br> 
<br>Whether you have been using hemp plant extracts for a long time or have recently discovered it, you should be very cautious in choosing the right product and make sure that you only buy high quality products from trusted brands.<br> 
<br>CBDPure is among the highest rated brands that caters organic cbd oil products. We recommend it as a daily supplement along with balanced diet and regular exercise.
