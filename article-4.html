        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Almost 44 million people in the US are struggling from mental health issues in a given year. That is 1 in every 5 adults. The most common mental illnesses that affect the US is related to depression and anxiety disorders.<br><br>The common course of treatment is to take pharmaceutical drugs such as antidepressants and antipsychotics.<br><br>However, recent studies have shown that a chemical compound found in Cannabis sativa called cannabidiol can help relieve several symptoms of anxiety and depression.<br><br>In this article, you will learn how cannabidiol helps our body achieve “internal balance” and ways on how to use cbd oil for anxiety and depression.<br> 
<br><strong>What is Cannabidiol?<br></strong>
<br>Cannabidiol or cbd is a chemical compound that can be extracted from cannabis plant, commonly known as marijuana or hemp. It is one of the cannabinoids that can be found in the plant.<br> 
<br>Because of the negative notions that come with the words “hemp” and “marijuana”, it was only in the recent years when studies and researches have given thought in the positive benefits that the plant can give.<br> 
<br>Contrary to popular belief, not everything about marijuana can make you stoned. CBD is a cannabinoid that does not have psychoactive effects. It is extracted from the leaves, flowers, and stalks of the plant which is unlike the common hemp oil in the market which is extracted from the seed.<br> 
<br><strong>CBD and THC<br></strong>
<br>Marijuana has been studied for years because of its ability to ease symptoms of anxiety, lessen pain, and stop seizures from occurring.<br>
<br>CBD, although sometimes mistaken as THC, the other cannabinoid found in hemp, are very different from each other. THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is responsible for the “high” in marijuana while CBD is much safer and have more benefits.<br> 
<br>CBD and THC both affect the endocannabinoid system but in different ways.<br> The endocannabinoid system was discovered during studies of how cannabis affects our body, and surprisingly, that is how it got its name since it means that our body naturally does process and produce cannabinoids.<br> 
<br>The endocannabinoid system mainly affects a person’s mood, appetite, memory, and pain-sensation. THC binds directly to the cannabinoid receptors of the system which results to the feeling of being “high”.<br><br>On the contrary, CBD still stimulates the cb receptors but is done indirectly thus, reaping the benefits without being stoned.<br> 
<br><strong>Effects of CBD and other uses<br></strong>
<br>If you are struggling from social anxiety disorder or your mind just shuts down at the thought of public speaking, cannabidiol oil helps in relaxing your nerves and lowers your levels of stress. It can also lessen the occurrence of panic attacks.<br><br> This is the main purpose why many people nowadays are using cbd oil.<br>Alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders are the most common reasons for the consumption of cbd. But aside from that, there are also other beneficial effects in using cbd that are backed up by researches and studies.<br>
<br>Other effects and uses of CBD includes the following:<br>
<br>1.	Anti-inflammatory
<br>2.	Antidepressant
<br>3.	Antipsychotic
<br>4.	Anti-seizure 
<br>5.	Cancer preventive
<br>6.	Pain reliever<br>
<br>Sounds like a miracle oil, right? But that’s not all. It also has fewer side effects unlike some pharmaceutical drugs.<br><br>Known and commonly reported side effects of cannabidiol oil are changes in appetite, weight loss or gain, feelings of tiredness, and diarrhea. The benefits of cbd clearly outweighs these side effects.<br>
<br><strong>Cannabidiol oil and Anxiety disorders<br></strong>
<br>Unlike most antidepressant drugs, cbd oil reduces risk for suicide and helps improve sleep.<br><br>There are now a lot of studies that strongly supports that cbd can be used as a form of treatment for anxiety disorders such as PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder, general anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, OCD or obsessive-compulsive disorder, and panic disorder.<br>
<br>In a study done in 2011, 24 patients who have social anxiety disorder and never been treated were tested. One set were given cbd while the other set is given placebo. They don’t know if they were given the placebo or the cbd.<br><br>As the results have shown, after undergoing simulation public speaking test (SPST) the set of people who were given the placebo were significantly more anxious than the set of people who received cbd treatment.<br>
<br>This is just one of the studies that connect the intake of cbd and lessened anxiety symptoms.<br>
<br><strong>Choosing the best product<br></strong>
<br>You can think of it as a dietary supplement. With just the right concentration of the substance in your body, the best effects can be achieved. This is why it is highly recommended to be taken daily.<br> 
<br>So, whether you’re a constant consumer of CBD or just about to start trying it out, you should only use cbd oil products that are of good quality and have already been tested and are certified to be organic.<br> 
<br>CBDPure is the most recommended cbd oil in the market. The product came from organically raised hemps that are grown free from any forms of contaminant. It is also laboratory tested and is guaranteed to have no presence of pesticides and residual solvents.<br><br>It is available in 100mg, 300mg, and 500mg bottles. It is also considered to be the best product with regards to quality and price since it is 100% pure cbd oil.<br> 
<br>If you’re wondering how to use cbd oil for anxiety, there are a lot of ways it can be done. Whether it’s eating or vaping, you can find a way to include it in your daily regimen that best suits you.<br><br>Here are some examples of how you can use cbd oil:<br>
<br>•	Add ½ teaspoon (or as indicated by the product) of cbd oil on smoothies or fruit juices
<br>•	Infusing it with tea
<br>•	Additional ingredient in baking
<br>•	Direct intake by administering the oil under the tongue
<br>•	Use as vape oil for vape pen<br>
<br>Other recipes that include cbd oil as an ingredient are available on the internet. Users of cbd oil have come up with a lot of ways to creatively add cbd in their food.<br>
<br>Since CBDPure does not contain artificial flavorings, adding it as an ingredient won’t alter the taste of the food as much as other cbd oil. However, among all the other ways on how to use cbd oil for anxiety, administering it directly under the tongue is easier and more preferable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
